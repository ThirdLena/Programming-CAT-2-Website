        <h2>About</h2>
        </div>
        <p><b>YOASOBI</b> is a Japanese pop duo formed in 2019. It consists of musician and record producer Ayase and singer-songwriter Lilas Ikuta who goes under the stage name Ikura</p>
        <p>Their Band name comes from the japanese word <b>"夜遊び"</b> Which means "Nightlife". Ayase chose this name to symbolise how they wanted their normal daily life to be seperated from their music which they mainly made at night</p>
        <p>They represent themselves with the slogan "novel into music"<b>(小説を音楽にするユニット)</b> Therefore, if their song is not based on a fictional story, they are not credited under Yoasobi but under their indiviual names.</p>
        <p> 
            Before forming the band, both of the members had active careers in music. Ayase was the Vocalist of <b>Davinci</b>, a rock band. It was active from 2012-2018 and eventually disbanded in 2020
            <br>
            <br>
            Lilas Ikuta, who later adopted the stage Ikura, was a singer-songwriter of the cover group <b>Plusonica</b> from 2017 to 2021

        <h2>Artistry</h2>
        <p>
            Yoasobi's musical style has been mainly described as a mix of pop, rock, electronic, During an interview with Associated press Ayase explained their music genre: "We think that Yoasobi is its own genre. There's no specific genre they're going after we're going after. We're definitely influenced by J-pop in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            In their childhood, Ayase was influenced by '80s and '90s music, K-pop, J-pop, and folk music. While Ikura enjoyed Western music such as songs from Disney, folk, and country music, as well as Japanese R&B and hip-hop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ayase interprets and writes Yoasobi's songs reflecting on his feelings and experiences based on the story. While Ikura sings them on the perspective of the protagonist or narrator of the story, not from herself.
